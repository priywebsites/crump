Make it visually active ‚Äî a lot of smooth, elegant, stylish animations.

Modern UI:

Use rounded buttons, modern typography (e.g., Poppins, Urbanist, or Inter), and glassmorphism or neumorphism where appropriate.

Smooth gradients, soft shadows, glowing effects, layered elements.

Include sticky nav, animated hero section, dynamic appointment CTA, and interactive elements.

Page Sections:

Landing/Hero Section:
